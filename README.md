### Topics I Want to Learn to Benefit from AI With
- Code Cleanup/Identify Underutilized or Useless Code
  - I Have Struggled in times with developing an app and keeping useless code in, or having code that could be better formatted be longer than needed. This can slow down compile times and ultimately create a less desired app. I want to use AI to help me identify parts of my code that could be cleaned up or flat out removed to create a better and simpler file structure.
- Idea Generation, Development, and Expansion
  - While I have a very good order of ideas already planned out, I will want to continue adding to this website as time goes on. I will utilize by peers first and foremost, but when ideas run dry, I will want to turn to AI to bounce ideas off of and generate. The only downside to this is that AI is very much a "Yes-Man" with ideas, and never can properly critique an idea, so I will seek to run ideas by my peers first before asking AI for opinions.
- Enquire about Unknown Functions/Features to Better App Experience
  - While I am comfortable with HTML/CSS/JS, there are many features about these, especially JavaScript, that are unknown to me, and I will seek to use AI to help bring my ideas to fruition without letting AI take over my code. I intend to keep my inquires to simple questions like, "Can I do ... in JS?", "Can I change this to ...?", etc.
